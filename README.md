Background
==========

The game begins by creating a 3x3 grid, with eight of grid segments holding a part of a whole image, and the ninth segment is blank. The nine segments are scrambled in random order at the beginning of the game, and it is then the job of the user to reassemble the image by moving the blank segment around the board by using the arrow keys.
